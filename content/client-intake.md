# Client Intake Questionnaire

## For the Website Contact Form (keep it short — 6 fields max)

1. **Name**
2. **Email**
3. **Project Location** (city or address)
4. **Property Type** — dropdown: Existing home / New construction / Remodel / Commercial
5. **What are you looking for?** — checkboxes:
   - Full landscape design
   - Concept book / plant palette only
   - Construction consulting / project management
   - Not sure yet — just exploring
6. **Tell us about your project** — open text (optional)

No budget field on the public form — it scares away high-end clients. We qualify budget in the first conversation.

## For First Call / Email (Internal — Sofia asks these)

### The Property
- Address / location
- Property size (approx)
- New build, renovation, or established landscape?
- Any existing features to keep? (mature trees, hardscape, pool, etc.)
- HOA or design review board restrictions?

### The Vision
- What do you want to *feel* when you're outside? (relaxed, entertained, private, open)
- Any styles or projects that inspire you? (send photos/links)
- How do you use your outdoor space now? How do you want to use it?
- Entertaining? Kids? Pets? Pool? Fire pit? Outdoor kitchen?
- Any plants you love or hate?

### Practical
- Timeline — when do you want to start? Any deadlines?
- Have you worked with a landscape designer before?
- Do you have a contractor, or do you need construction management?
- Budget range — we ask this conversationally, not as a form field:
  - "To make sure we're designing something realistic, do you have a range in mind?"
  - Guide: Under $50k / $50-100k / $100-250k / $250k+

### Red Flags (internal — don't ask, just note)
- Wants a full design for under $10k
- "Can you just give us a plant list?"
- Won't share budget at all
- Wants it done in 2 weeks
- Comparing you to Home Depot
