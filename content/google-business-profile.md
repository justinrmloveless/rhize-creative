## Description (750 char max)
Rhize Creative is a landscape design practice based on the California coast, specializing in residential landscapes between Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Malibu. We bring rare fluency in both design and construction — every project is conceived and documented with buildability in mind. Services include full landscape design, concept books with detailed plant palettes, and construction consulting. Our work is rooted in California native and Mediterranean planting, drought-intelligent design, and materials chosen for how they age. If you're looking for a landscape that feels inevitable — like it was always part of the property — let's talk.
