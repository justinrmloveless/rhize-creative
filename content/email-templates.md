## 1. Initial Inquiry Response (within 24 hours)

**Subject:** Your project in [Location]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for reaching out. We'd love to learn more about what you're envisioning for your property in [Location].

To get started, a few quick questions:

- Can you share a bit more about the space — is this a new build, renovation, or an established landscape?
- Are there any particular styles, materials, or plants that inspire you?
- What's your ideal timeline?

Once we have a better sense of the project, we'll set up a call or site visit with Justin to walk the property together.

Looking forward to it.

Best,
Sofia Garcia

Circling back one more time on the proposal. We'd love to work on this project, but understand timing isn't always right.

## Usage Notes
- Sofia sends templates 1, 2, 4, 5
- Justin sends template 3 (proposal) — his name carries weight on the formal stuff
- Always personalize — these are starting points, not copy/paste
- Response time goal: under 24 hours on initial inquiries
- Tone: warm but professional. Never desperate. Never salesy.
