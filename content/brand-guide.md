## Voice & Tone

**We are:** Refined. Confident. Understated. Knowledgeable.
**We are not:** Salesy. Loud. Corporate. Casual/bro-ish.

**Writing principles:**
- Speak like a designer, not a contractor
- Short sentences. Let the work breathe.
- Poetic when describing design. Precise when describing process.
- Never oversell. Confidence is quiet.
- "We" not "I" in public-facing copy (even though it's Justin — the brand is bigger)

**Example tones:**
- ✅ "A landscape that feels inevitable — as though it was always part of the property."
- ✅ "Specified for how it weathers, not just how it looks today."
- ❌ "We'll build you an amazing backyard!"
- ❌ "Our team of experts is passionate about landscaping!"

## Photography Style
- Natural light, golden hour preferred
- Muted, warm tones (not oversaturated)
- Show the landscape in context — the whole scene, not just close-ups
- People are secondary — the land is the subject
- Before/afters: same angle, same framing

## Social Media
- Clean grid aesthetic on Instagram
- Minimal text on images
- Consistent filter/editing style
- Caption tone matches brand voice — refined but human
