## Justin's Bio (Draft — needs his voice/review)

I've been in construction my whole career — managing projects, solving problems on sites up and down the California coast. Landscape was always the part that stuck with me. Not just how it looks, but how it works. How the soil drains, what survives a July without water, which stone weathers right.

Rhize Creative came from that. The name's a play on rhizome — the root network underground that connects everything. That's how I think about landscape design. What you see on the surface only works if what's underneath is right.

I do things differently because I come from the construction side. I've seen too many beautiful designs fall apart in the build. Every project I take on, I'm thinking about how it gets built — not just how it looks on paper.

Based in Ventura. Working Santa Barbara to Malibu and everywhere in between. When I'm not on a site or sketching, I'm probably in the water.

## Philosophy Section

**Design with the land, not against it.**
Every site tells you what it wants to be if you listen. The light, the grade, the way water moves. We start there.

**Build it right the first time.**
A beautiful plan means nothing if it's built wrong. Construction knowledge isn't optional — it's the foundation.

**Plant for where you are.**
California natives. Mediterranean species. Drought-smart palettes. Plants that thrive here because they belong here.

**Nothing extra.**
Every element earns its place. The best landscapes feel effortless — like they were always there.
