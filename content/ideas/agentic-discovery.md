# Idea: Agentic Discovery — How AI Finds Us

**Question from Justin:** As AI agents become the way people search (not just Google SEO), how does Rhize Creative become the reference material those agents pull from?

## The Shift
People are moving from "Google → click → browse" to "ask an AI → get a recommendation." When someone asks Claude or ChatGPT "who's a good landscape designer in Santa Barbara?", what determines whether Rhize shows up in that answer?

## Threads to Explore
- Structured data / schema markup that AI can parse
- Being cited in the right places (publications, directories, forums)
- Content that answers questions AI gets asked (plant lists, design guides, regional expertise)
- API-accessible portfolio data
- llms.txt or similar AI-readable site metadata
- Building authority as a *knowledge source*, not just a service provider
- The concept book as a format AI can reference and recommend

## Core Insight
SEO optimizes for Google's algorithm. The next game optimizes for being the answer an AI gives. That means being genuinely useful, authoritative, and well-structured — not just keyword-stuffed.
