            Great landscapes aren't designed on a screen — they're found in the land itself. 
            The way light falls across a slope. How water wants to move. What the soil is asking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rhize Creative is built on that instinct. The name comes from <em>rhizome</em> — the 
            unseen root network that connects and sustains everything above. It's how we approach 
            every project. Surface beauty is easy. We design what holds it together.
          </p>
          <p>
            What sets this practice apart is rare fluency in both design and construction. Every 
            material is specified because it weathers beautifully. Every grading decision is made 
            because it builds cleanly. The result is a landscape that feels inevitable — as though 
            it was always part of the property.

            Based on the California coast, working between Santa Barbara, Malibu, and the central 
            coast. Specializing in residential landscapes that are understated, enduring, and 
            deeply site-specific.

          <p class="text-sand/80 leading-relaxed">Every site has a language. We read it — the light, the grade, the way the wind shapes what grows. The best designs don't impose; they reveal what was already there.</p>

          <h3 class="text-sm uppercase tracking-wide text-clay mb-3">Design Meets Construction</h3>
          <p class="text-sand/80 leading-relaxed">Fluency in both disciplines means nothing is designed that can't be built beautifully. Specifications are precise. Materials are chosen for how they age, not just how they look today.</p>

          <p class="text-sand/80 leading-relaxed">California natives, Mediterranean species, drought-intelligent palettes. Plants selected not for trend but for belonging — species that thrive because they're where they should be.</p>
